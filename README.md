## Background

I grew up in 6 cities in 5 different states across the U.S. Some of my favorite memories come from building computers and cars with my dad; buying individual RAM memory chips for our 386 to upgrading turbos on one our GMC Syclones.

I went to school to combine my love for art and computer science together. I started working at UCF as a student and formed a web development company on the side. The combination gave me a variety of web development, course development, and entrepreneurial experiences.

After graduation I joined UCF as a full time web developer, with the aim to build the future of digital learning. In my tenure at UCF, I grew from a disinterested junior to a senior level team lead. We had a enjoyably diverse group of developers playing with all sorts of cool tech. Growing with and shaping the Techrangers® was such an enjoyable experience. We ended up building one of the best places in Orlando to start a software development career. Just looking at where [our alumni](https://techrangers.cdl.ucf.edu/past-techrangers.html) went off to work is amazing.

After the Techrangers, I remotely joined a consultancy who's mission is build things that make a positive impact on the world as the Director of Engineering. I spent most of my time in team and management tasks, but did occasionally fill in the gaps on our various projects. Just as I was really starting to adapt and settle into my role at CrossComm, the universe sent me a linkedIn alert from a bucket list oppurtunity...

In June 2022, my wife and I sold our house of 15 years, quit our jobs, put the cats in our backpacks, and moved to northern Europe. I had landed a job working with the Infotainment and Cloud team at Christian von Koenigsegg's super car factory in Ängelholm, Sweden. I got the chance to write code and mingle with the best designers and engineers in the world. Between commits, I got to see the first prototypes for [Jesko](https://youtu.be/E8fYy_5gXDg?si=yc_4v6uHUqn29mtY), [CC850](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LfkTodFuxg), and [Gemera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbDLHkMMvFc) come to life downstairs. Not to mention the [grand opening of the Gripen Atelier](https://www.instagram.com/koenigsegg/p/Cul--hNIPCw/?img_index=1). Ok, I'm gonna brag a bit, I rode in the [0-400-0 record Regera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaEpYc3YLz4) and the [imperial blue pre-production Jesko Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpJlGzM2PAc)!

## Background

I grew up in 6 cities in 5 different states across the U.S. Some of my favorite memories come from building computers and cars with my dad; buying individual RAM memory chips for our 386 to upgrading turbos on one our GMC Syclones.

I went to school to combine my love for art and computer science together. I started working at UCF as a student and formed a web development company on the side. The combination gave me a variety of web development, course development, and entrepreneurial experiences.

After graduation I joined UCF as a full time web developer, with the aim to build the future of digital learning. In my tenure at UCF, I grew from a disinterested junior to a senior level team lead.  We had a enjoyably diverse group of developers playing with all sorts of cool tech. Growing with and shaping the Techrangers® was such an enjoyable experience.  We ended up building one of the best places in Orlando to start a software development career.  Just looking at where [our alumni](https://techrangers.cdl.ucf.edu/past-techrangers.html) went off to work is amazing.  

After the Techrangers, I remotely joined a consultancy who's mission is build things that make a positive impact on the world as the Director of Engineering. I spent most of my time in team and management tasks, but did occasionally fill in the gaps on our various projects.  Just as I was really starting to adapt and settle into my role at CrossComm, the universe sent me a linkedIn alert from a bucket list oppurtunity...

In June 2022, my wife and I sold our house of 15 years, quit our jobs, put the cats in our backpacks, and moved to northern Europe. I had landed a job working with the Infotainment and Cloud team at Christian von Koenigsegg's super car factory in Ängelholm, Sweden.  I got the chance to write code and mingle with the best designers and engineers in the world. Between commits, I got to see the first prototypes for Jesko, CC850, and Gemera come to life downstairs (I'm gonna brag a bit - I got to ride in the 0-400-0 record holding Regera and the imperial blue pre-production Jesko Attack!).

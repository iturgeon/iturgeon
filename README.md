## Background

I grew up in 6 cities in 5 different states across the U.S. Some of my favorite memories come from building computers and cars with my dad; buying individual RAM memory chips for our 386 to upgrading turbos on one our GMC Syclones.

I went to school to combine my love for art and computer science together. I started working at UCF as a student and formed a web development company on the side. The combination gave me a variety of web development, course development, and entrepreneurial experiences.

After graduation I joined UCF as a full time web developer, with the aim to build the future of digital learning. Now, I'm a senior dev on the team, working with an enjoyably diverse group of developers and playing with all sorts of cool tech. The TechrangersÂ® have never been better, we're always striving to make it the best place in Orlando to start a software development career.  Judging by where our alumni work - I think it's clear we're doing something right.

In the end, it's a really enjoyable place with some very talented people building important, socially responsible projects.  Not a bad place to be :)
